Features



   Existing Features
F01 Navigation Bar
The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three pages of the website supporting easy navigation. It includes a simple Logo, Home page, Menu and Contact links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes. On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move to under the Logo.

                  F02 Landing Page image - Artist Biography & Philosophy  
The landing area includes a photograph and text below that together clearly identify the purpose of the business and the type of product & service it offers. The intriguing image and bio are intended to be appealing to the user and convey a sense of tranquillity, expression of freedom and holistic wellbeing. Immersive description of Jack Smith's artistic philosophy and love for capturing fleeting moments in nature.

Featured Work:
Carousel showcasing selected landscape photos.




 




F02 Footer
The footer is featured on all three pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use. It contains three sections:

Social Media Links - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected. The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As JACK SMITH PHOTOGRAPHY is a fictitious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)


Copyright Notice - The copyright notice at the end of a website serves as a formal declaration of the creator's ownership of the content on the site. It indicates that the material is protected by copyright law and specifies the rights granted to users. Including a copyright notice helps deter unauthorized use of the content and informs visitors about the legal status of the material.

F03 Gallery Page - ‘Gallery’
          A curated collection of high-quality images categorized by seasons.
         Gallery sections include "Ancient Secluded Gorge," "Coastline Cliffs," "Glacially             Formed Lake," Mountains remains from Clusters of Forgotten Volcanoes and more.



F04 Contact Page - ‘Contact’
- Information on how to get in touch, inquire about commissions, or purchase prints.
- [Contact Form](contact.html) for convenient communication.
The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, there are radio buttons to choose three options. The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email. Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed).
The panel is to complete a form within a designated graphical interface, and the call to action is conditioned to activate only when the form is appropriately filled out, ensuring valid data submission.

To provide a user-friendly experience, there is  a visual indicator (error messages) indicating that the form needs to be filled out correctly before the CTA can be activated.

Design



Imagery
The design layout features a clean and minimalistic structure with a simple white background, providing a visually uncluttered canvas. Imagery is elegantly incorporated with prominent landscape photos, enhancing the aesthetic appeal, while a restrained colour palette ensures a cohesive and tranquil user experience.
Typography
Google Fonts were used to import Lato and Raleway fonts into styles.css. These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, minimalistic feel that is easy to read.
