#### The Footer:
The footer is featured on all three pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use. It contains three sections:

- Social Media Links - This area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected. The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As JACK SMITH PHOTOGRAPHY is a fictitious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

- Copyright Notice - The copyright notice at the end of a website serves as a formal declaration of the creator's ownership of the content on the site. It indicates that the material is protected by copyright law and specifies the rights granted to users. Including a copyright notice helps deter unauthorized use of the content and informs visitors about the legal status of the material.

#### Contact Us Page:
The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, there are radio buttons to choose three options. The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email. Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed).
The panel is to complete a form within a designated graphical interface, and the call to action is conditioned to activate only when the form is appropriately filled out, ensuring valid data submission.

To provide a user-friendly experience, there is  a visual indicator (error messages) indicating that the form needs to be filled out correctly before the CTA can be activated.

## Unfixed Bugs
As you will see from our Validator tests there were a few errors that we could not get around to in the allocated time we had to complete the project. As explained in our presentation we had a lot of issues you would expect in the first ever collabed project completed. Main being time being taken away learning merge conflicts etc.
